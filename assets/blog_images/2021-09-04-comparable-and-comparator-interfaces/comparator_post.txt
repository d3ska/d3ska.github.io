Java Comparable interface is used to order the objects of the user-defined class.
 This interface is found in java.lang package and contains only one method named compareTo(Object). 
It provides a single sorting sequence only, i.e., you can sort the elements on the basis of single data member only. 
For example, it may be name, age or anything else. 

compareTo(Object obj) method

public int compareTo(Object obj): It is used to compare the current object with the specified object. It returns

    positive integer, if the current object is greater than the specified object.
    negative integer, if the current object is less than the specified object.
    zero, if the current object is equal to the specified object.



Code Example, we need to implements Comparable interface first and override compareTo method.
