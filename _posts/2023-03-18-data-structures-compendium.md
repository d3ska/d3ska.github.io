Data structures are the building blocks of efficient software. You do not need to know every one, but a solid grasp of the fundamentals and when to reach for each will take you a long way.

Here are the core topics:

* [Complexity Analysis](/posts/complexity-analysis/) - understanding how to measure and compare algorithm efficiency using time and space complexity.
* [Memory](/posts/memory/) - how data is stored and accessed in RAM, including the distinction between stack and heap memory.
* [Big O Notation](/posts/big-o-notation/) - the standard notation for describing the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate.
* [Logarithm](/posts/logarithm/) - the mathematical concept behind the efficiency of divide-and-conquer algorithms and balanced trees.
* [Arrays](/posts/arrays/) - contiguous blocks of memory offering O(1) access by index, the most fundamental data structure.
* [Linked Lists](/posts/linked-lists/) - sequences of nodes where each node points to the next, enabling efficient insertions and deletions.
* [Hash Tables](/posts/hash-tables/) - key-value stores providing average O(1) lookup through hashing functions.
* [Stacks and Queues](/posts/stacks-and-queues/) - LIFO and FIFO structures used extensively in algorithms, parsing, and scheduling.
* [Strings](/posts/strings/) - sequences of characters with their own set of manipulation techniques and pattern-matching algorithms.
* [Graphs](/posts/graphs/) - collections of vertices and edges that model relationships and networks.
* [Trees](/posts/trees/) - hierarchical structures with a root node and children, fundamental to searching and sorting.
* [Depth First Search in Java](/posts/depth-first-search-in-java/) - a tree/graph traversal algorithm that explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Additional data structures worth knowing about:

* **Heaps** - specialized tree-based structures that satisfy the heap property (min-heap or max-heap), commonly used to implement priority queues. Heaps provide O(1) access to the minimum or maximum element and O(log n) insertions and deletions.
* **Tries (Prefix Trees)** - tree-like structures optimized for storing and searching strings by their prefixes. Tries excel at problems involving autocomplete, spell-checking, and IP routing, offering O(m) lookup time where m is the length of the key.
