#### What are data structures? 

Data structures can be thought of as tools used to solve various problems. They often involve complexity and mathematical concepts, and can sometimes be quite intricate. However, it's not necessary to know everything about every data structure. Instead, it's more important to have a deep understanding of certain key concepts and be able to apply them effectively.
