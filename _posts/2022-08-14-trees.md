a data structure that is constructed with nodes, where each has some value and may point to child-nodes, which recursively form subtrees in the tree.

The first node in a tree is called a **root**, some nodes on the bottom of the tree may not have child-nodes, and they are referred to as a **leaf-nodes** or just **leaves**. 
<br>
The **height** of a tree is the length of its longest branch. **Branches** are paths between root, and it leaves. 
<br>
The **depth** of a tree node is a distance from its tree's root, it's also known as a node's **level** in the tree.


A tree  is basically a **graph** that's **connected**, **directed** and **acyclic**, that has an explicit root node, and whose nodes all have a single **parent** (except a root node which hasn't parent). You may find out more about graphs [here](https://matthewonsoftware.com/blog/graphs) 
In most of the implementations nodes does not have a pointer to their parent, but they can if it's desired. 

There are many types of trees, like **binary trees**, **heaps**, **AVL** and more.

- **Binary Tree**

A **tree** whose elements have at most **two** children nodes.

The structure of a binary tree is such that many of its operations have a logarithmic time complexity, making the binary tree an incredibly attractive and commonly used data structure.
Why its usually logarithmic complexity, because whenever we choose one of child-node we reject the second half.  

Read more about **logarithms** [**here**](https://matthewonsoftware.com/blog/logarithm).


- **K-ary Tree**

A **tree** whose nodes have up to **k** child-nodes. A **binary tree** is a k-ary tree where **k==2**.


- **Complete Binary Tree**

It's almost **perfect** A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.

- **Perfect Binary Tree**

A **binary tree** whose interior nodes all have two child-nodes whose **leaf nodes** all have the same **depth**.
Example:

- **Balanced Binary Tree**

A **binary tree** whose nodes all have left and right **subtrees** whose **heights** differ by no more than 1.

A balanced binary tree is such that the logarithmic time complexity of its operations is maintained.

Inserting a node at the bottom of the following imbalanced binary tree right subtree would clearly not be a logarithmic time operation, since it would involve traversing through most tree nodes.


- **Full Binary Tree**

A **Binary Tree** whose nodes all have either two child-nodes or zero child-nodes.
