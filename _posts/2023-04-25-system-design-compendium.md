System design is a part of the system development process, focusing on the creation of a comprehensive blueprint for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It includes the specification of the system's architecture, modules, interfaces and data necessary to satisfy a set of requirements.

In simpler terms, system design is like constructing a roadmap for a complex mechanism. This roadmap delineates the system's components, how they interact, and work together to fulfill the system's objectives or requirements.

Effective system design should consider both the system's functional requirements—what the system should do—and its non-functional requirements, such as scalability, reliability, robustness, and security.

Here are the topics that merit your focused attention and comprehension:
