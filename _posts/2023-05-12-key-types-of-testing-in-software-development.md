Software testing is an integral part of the development process. Each type of testing has its specific purpose and helps ensure the highest quality of the final product. Here are the most crucial types of tests used in software development.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests operate at the lowest level, targeting individual methods, classes, components, and modules without any integration with other modules or involving any database communication or simulated HTTP traffic. These are considered "small tests" according to Google's scale and involve a single process.

Unit tests are quick to execute and involve simple objects, structures, stubs, and mocks, without the need for setting up and running application frameworks.

```java
@Test
void verificationShouldPassForAgeBetween18And99() {
    // given
    AgeVerification verification = new AgeVerification(22);
    // when
    boolean passes = verification.passes();
    // then
    assertThat(passes).isTrue();
}
```


### Integration Tests

Integration tests are designed to verify the integration and interaction between different modules. They check whole groups of modules responsible for specific business functionalities. They validate the consistency of returned results concerning business requirements and the interaction between the individual modules within the group.

They also test integration with the infrastructure. According to Google's scale, these tests are considered "medium tests" and are performed on a single machine.

```java
@Test
void shouldFailWithConnectionResetByPeer() {
    WireMock.stubFor(WireMock.get("/18210116954")
        .willReturn(WireMock.aResponse().withFault(Fault.CONNECTION_RESET_BY_PEER)));

    BDDAssertions.thenThrownBy(() -> service.verify(zbigniew()))
        .hasRootCauseInstanceOf(IOException.class);
}
```


### End-to-End Tests

End-to-End tests simulate the complete flow of a given process in an application or distributed system from beginning to end. They are intended to mimic real-life scenarios of end-users and verify the correctness of entire business processes, data consistency, integration of different applications that are part of the system, and communication with external systems.

Google's scale classifies these as "large tests" and they often require dedicated testing environments, databases, queues, and network protocols similar to those used in production.

```java
@Test
void shouldDisplayErrorMessage() {
    $(byLinkText("ERROR")).click();
    $(byText("Something happened...")).shouldBe(Condition.visible);
}
```

### Manual Tests

Manual tests are performed by people who have a good understanding of the business side of a given system. They verify entire business processes and user scenarios in dedicated testing environments with data similar to production data.

### Performance Tests

Performance tests verify the system's performance under a given load. Specialized tools like JMeter are used for performance and load testing. The design of the load is based on the current and anticipated system load as well as key performance indicators (KPIs).

### User Testing

User tests are performed by potential end-users who carry out specific tasks or processes in the application. These tests are monitored by a UX specialist to identify problematic areas from a user experience perspective.

### Conclusion

Remember, each type of testing serves its purpose, and their collective use ensures the development of a robust, user-friendly, and efficient software system.
