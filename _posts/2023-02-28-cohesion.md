### Cohesion 

Cohesion is a measure of how well the parts of a module fit together. A module is considered cohesive when all its components are closely related and packaged together. 
Breaking the module into smaller parts would lead to increased coupling between modules, as they would need to communicate with each other in order to achieve the desired results.

> Attempting to divide a cohesive module would only result in increased coupling and decreased readability. <br>

### Functional cohesion
Every part of the module is related to the other, and the module contains everything essential to function.
<br>

### Sequential cohesion
Every part of the module is related to the other, and the module contains every thing essential to function.
<br>

### Communicational cohesion
Two modules form a communication chain, where each operates on information and/or contributes to some output. For example, add a record to the database and generate an email based on that information.
<br>

### Procedural cohesion
Two modules must execute code in particular order.
<br>

### Temporal cohesion
Modules are related based on timing dependencies. For example, many systems have a list of seemingly unrelated things that must be initialized at system startup; these different tasks are temporally cohesive.
<br>

### Coincidental cohesion
Elements in a module are not related other than being in the same source file; this represents **the most negative** form of cohesion.

### LCOM

Lack of Cohesion of methods is a metric that measures the structural cohesion of a module, typically a component.
In other words it's the sum of sets of methods not shared via sharing fields.

Consider a class with private fields _a_ and _b_. Many of the methods only access _a_, and many other methods only access _b_.
The _sum_ of the sets of methods not shared via sharing fields (_a_ and _b_) is high; therefore, this class reports a high LCOM score, indicating that it scores high in _lack of cohesion in methods_.
Consider the three classes shown below.

Fields appear as single letters and methods appear as blocks. In _Class X_, the LCOM score is low, indicating good structural cohesion. 
_Class Y_, however, lacks cohesion; each of the field/method pairs in _Class Y_ could appear in its own class without affecting behavior. 
_Class Z_ shows mixed cohesion, where developers could refactor the last field/method combination into its own class.
